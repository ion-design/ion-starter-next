# Brand Guidelines

This skill provides company-specific brand identity context.

## How to use

1. Read `company-docs/brand-guidelines.md` for the company's full brand guidelines (colors, typography, design language, component patterns, voice, strategy).
2. Apply those guidelines to all design decisions, image generation prompts, and visual artifacts.
3. If `company-docs/brand-guidelines.md` does not exist, note that no brand guidelines are available and proceed with best judgment using clean, professional defaults.
